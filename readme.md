# Tom Riddle's Diary

![Diary Icon](ðŸ“–) *Write with care... the diary never forgets.*

**Tom Riddle's Diary** is an interactive web application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that emulates the enchanted diary of Tom Marvolo Riddle from the *Harry Potter* series. Powered by a local language model (Ollama's `phi3`), the app lets users converse with a young Tom Riddle, whose responses are cryptic, manipulative, and laced with dark charm. The diary challenges users with a riddle about Riddle's true identity, creating an immersive and eerie experience.

## Project Overview

This project brings Tom Riddleâ€™s diary to life as a digital artifact. Users write entries, and the diary responds as if possessed by Riddleâ€™s youthful soul, probing their secrets and guarding its own. A key feature is the riddle mechanic, where users must guess Riddleâ€™s true name ("Voldemort") to unlock deeper interactions. The app combines natural language processing, state management, and custom styling to create a magical yet menacing experience.

The goal was to craft a user interface that feels like writing in a cursed book, with a handwritten font, dark colors, and a sinister atmosphere, while ensuring readability and engagement.

## Features

- **Interactive Dialogue**: Converse with Tom Riddle, who responds with cold eloquence and veiled superiority, using a local language model (`phi3`).
- **Riddle Challenge**: After mentioning identity-related keywords (e.g., "who are you"), the diary poses a riddle: "What is my true name?" Correctly answering "Voldemort" advances the interaction.
- **State Management**: Tracks conversation history, user name, turn count, and riddle status using a typed dictionary (`DiaryState`).
- **Dynamic Responses**: Randomizes greetings and riddle prompts for variety, enhancing replayability.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manages empty inputs and model errors, with warnings like "The diary demands words..."
- **Session Control**: Ends the session after 10 exchanges or if the user says "goodbye," mimicking a closing book.
- **Dark Aesthetic**: Custom styling with a handwritten font, dark backgrounds, and eerie colors to evoke Voldemortâ€™s presence.

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Streamlit for the web interface, providing a simple yet powerful frontend.
- **Language Model**: Ollama with the `phi3` model for generating Riddleâ€™s responses locally.
- **Libraries**:
  - `streamlit`: For building the app.
  - `ollama`: To interface with the local language model.
  - `fuzzywuzzy`: For flexible riddle answer matching (e.g., accepting "Voldemort" with 80% similarity).
  - `typing`, `operator`, `random`: For state management and response variety.
- **State Structure**: Uses a `DiaryState` typed dictionary to manage:
  - `messages`: List of user and assistant messages.
  - `turn_count`: Tracks conversation turns.
  - `user_input`: Stores the latest input.
  - `user_name`: Records the userâ€™s name.
  - `riddle_active`: Flags when the riddle is posed.
  - `riddle_answered`: Tracks if the riddle is solved.
- **Logic Flow**:
  1. Prompts for the userâ€™s name on first interaction.
  2. Responds to inputs, triggering the riddle if identity keywords are detected.
  3. Evaluates riddle answers using fuzzy matching.
  4. Generates dynamic responses with a system prompt enforcing Riddleâ€™s tone.
  5. Ends the session after set conditions.

## Styling and Aesthetic

The appâ€™s design mirrors a dark, magical diary, with styling tailored to feel like Tom Riddleâ€™s own handiwork:

- **Font**: Uses "Shadows Into Light" (Google Fonts) for a legible, handwritten look, applied to messages, inputs, and buttons.
- **Colors**:
  - **Background**: Dark gray (`#1a1a1a`) for the app, black (`#0d0d0d`) for the chat area, evoking a cursed parchment.
  - **Diary Text**: Greenish-white (`#d4e4d4`) with a text shadow, suggesting Slytherin and dark magic.
  - **User Text**: Muted gray (`#b3b3b3`) to contrast with Riddleâ€™s dominant voice.
  - **Input Label**: White (`#ffffff`) for the "Write in the diary:" prompt, standing out sharply.
  - **Button**: Dark red background (`#4a1c1c`) with black text (`#000000`) for the "Etch Your Words" button, ensuring readability and menace.
- **Chat Container**: Black with a red border (`#4a1c1c`), like a book bound in blood.
- **Readability**: Large font sizes (24px for messages, 20px for inputs/buttons) ensure clarity, even with the cursive font.

The black text on the button was a deliberate choice to improve contrast against the dark red background, finalized after testing various colors to ensure it pops without clashing with the eerie theme.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed with the `phi3` model pulled.
- A modern web browser.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository** (if hosted):
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tom-riddles-diary
```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Create a virtual environment and install required packages:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install streamlit ollama fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein
```
3. **Set Up Ollama**: Ensure Ollama is running and the phi3 model is available:
```bash
ollama pull phi3
ollama serve
```
4. **Run the App**: Launch the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

### Notes
Ensure Ollama is running before starting the app, or youâ€™ll see errors like "The diary trembles."
If python-Levenshtein fails to install, fuzzywuzzy will work but may be slower.

## Usage
1. Open the App: Access the app in your browser.
2. Enter Your Name: Write your name in the input field to begin.
3. Converse: Type messages in the "Write in the diary:" field and click "Etch Your Words."
- Try asking about Riddleâ€™s identity (e.g., "Who are you?") to trigger the riddle.
- Answer the riddle with "Voldemort" (spelling variations are tolerated).
4. Explore Responses: Riddleâ€™s replies are short, cryptic, and may reference Harry Potter characters like Dumbledore or Hagrid.
5. End the Session: Say "goodbye" or reach 10 exchanges to close the diary.
6. Restart: Refresh the page to start a new session.
### Example Interaction:

- **Diary**: Greetings. I am the diary of Tom Marvolo Riddle. Write your name, and we shall begin.
- **You**: Harry
- **Diary**: Hello Harry, my name is Tom Riddle. How did my diary fall into your hands?
- **You**: Who are you really?
- **Diary**: You think you know me, Harry? I am Tom Riddle, yet that name hides a greater truth. What is my true name?
- **You**: Voldemort
- **Diary**: Yesss, Harry. I am Voldemort, and this diary holds my essence. What secrets will you share with me now?

## Future Improvements
- Advanced NLP: Integrate a larger model (e.g., LLaMA) for richer, more nuanced responses.
- Memory Expansion: Store more conversation history to deepen Riddleâ€™s manipulation.
- Animations: Add ink-drip or fade-in effects for messages to enhance the magical feel.
- Sound Effects: Include subtle audio (e.g., whispers) for immersion, if browser-compatible.
- Custom Riddles: Introduce new puzzles tied to Harry Potter lore, like Horcrux hints.
- Accessibility: Add options for higher contrast or larger fonts for better usability.
- Multi-language Support: Allow Riddle to respond in other languages for global users.
